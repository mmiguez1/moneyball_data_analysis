# Moneyball Data Analysis Tutorial

In this tutorial, I provide a walk-through of how I analyze how efficient baseball teams have been historically spending money and getting wins in return. In the case of Moneyball, one would expect that Oakland was not much more efficient than other teams in their spending before 2000, were much more efficient between 2000 and 2005, and by then other teams may have caught up.      
     
My goal in this project is to see how this is reflected in data. I wrangle, transform, and analyze data from Lahman's Baseball Database which contains information on baseball teams, players and seasons curated by Sean Lahman. Specifically, I look at Lahman's 2014 data using the Python SQLite and Pandas packages to access the data and load it into a pandas dataframe.
